# 🃏 CSC213 Project 1

---

*Allot at least 3 weeks to complete this project to be safe!*

This project is all about probabilities! You'll be implementing a Java program that simulates drawing hands from a
deck and tracking how long it takes to see every possible unique hand! This project will challenge your
understanding of Java collections, probability, file handling, and real-world software development practices.

There are many things that you will do in this project, including, but not limited to:

- Writing code to iterate through different deck and hand sizes.
- Utilizing a testing framework to run tests on methods, classes, and your entire codebase.
- Running multiple trials to measure the number of attempts needed to achieve full coverage.
- Output real-time progress updates and save the results to a CSV file for analysis.
- Setting up a GitHub repo to manage your code.
- Compiling your project into a .jar file.

The skeleton code for this project is found in this repo. **You will be responsible for *cloning* the project and
completing it.**

## 📂 Package Structure

This project follows a **Maven/Gradle-style structure**:

```
src/
 ├── main/java/edu/canisius/csc213/project1/Deck.java
 ├── test/java/edu/canisius/csc213/project1/DeckTest.java
```

It's usually a good idea to stick with this default structure. Otherwise, you have to manually change settings.

## Part 1. Defining the Card and the Deck Classes

In this part of the project, you will implement a `Card` class that represents a standard playing card. Each card has:

- A **suit** (♠ **Spades**, ♥ **Hearts**, ♦ **Diamonds**, ♣ **Clubs**)
- A **rank** (**2–10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace**)

Your task is to define the class and ensure that it passes the provided **JUnit tests**.

---

### 🔧 **Step 1: Define the `Card` Record**

Your `Card.java` should be placed in the `edu.canisius.csc213.project1` package and should contain a `Card` record
that has:

- **Two enums**: `Suit` and `Rank` (already provided below).
- Two private final fields for `Suit` and `Rank` (in that order).
    - These fields should be named `suit` and `rank`, respectively.
- An **override of `toString()`** to display cards in `"RANK of SUIT"` format.

Remember a `record` is a special kind of `class` often called a "data class" that helps prevent us from having to write
a bunch of boilerplate code. Said differently, since we are using a `record`, all getter methods, `equals()`,
`hascode()`, and even the constructor are automatically created for us!

```java
public enum Suit {HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS, SPADES}

public enum Rank {TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING, ACE}
```

---

### 🧪 **Step 2: Make Sure Your Card Record Passes All Tests!**

- A **JUnit test file** (`CardTest.java`) is provided to verify your implementation.
- You can determine what each of them test by looking at their corresponding javadocs and testing code.
- It is not guaranteed that your `Card` record function completely correctly if it passes all the tests, but it is a
  very good check!

---

### 🔧 **Step 3: Implement the `Deck` Class**

The `class Deck` in `Deck.java` represents a **custom-sized deck of playing cards**, supporting shuffling and
drawing.

#### **Deck Rules:**

1. The deck **size** must be a **multiple of 4**, up to a maximum of **52**.
2. If an invalid size is provided, the constructor **throws an `IllegalArgumentException`**.
3. The deck is built in the following order:
    - **4 cards → 4 Aces**
    - **8 cards → 4 Aces + 4 Kings**
    - **12 cards → 4 Aces + 4 Kings + 4 Queens**
    - … continues until **52 cards (full deck)**
4. The deck must have:
    - **A method to shuffle the cards**.
    - **A method to draw a card (removing it from the deck)**.
    - **A method to get the number of remaining cards**.

---

### 🧪 **Step 4: Make Sure Your Deck Class Passes All Tests!**

- A **JUnit test file** (`DeckTest.java`) is provided to verify your implementation.
- You can determine what each of them test by looking at their corresponding javadocs and testing code.
- It is not guaranteed that your `Deck` class functions entirely correctly if all tests pass, but it is a very good
  check!

## Part 2: Dealing Some Cards!

### 📂 **Final Project Structure**

Your project should now have this structure:

```
src/
 ├── main/java/edu/canisius/csc213/project1/
 │   ├── Card.java
 │   ├── Deck.java
 │   ├── UniqueHands.java  <-- (You will implement this!)
 ├── test/java/edu/canisius/csc213/project1/
 │   ├── CardTest.java
 │   ├── DeckTest.java
 │   ├── UniqueHandsTest.java  <-- (Unit tests are provided!)
```

---

### 🔧 **Step 1: Implement `UniqueHands.java`**

You will now implement the `UniqueHands` class, which simulates drawing random hands from a deck and measures how
long it takes to see every possible hand. This class must:

1. Runs 5 **trials** for different combinations of **deck sizes (24, 28)** and **hand sizes (6, 7)**.
2. Measure the number of attempts and time taken to see **every unique hand** for the given deck and hand sizes.
3. Compute and print the average results over all trials for each combination.

---

### 🧪 **Step 2a: Run the Unit Tests for `UniqueHands`**

- A **JUnit test file** (`UniqueHandsTest.java`) is provided to verify your implementation.
- You can determine what each of them test by looking at their corresponding javadocs and testing code.
- It is not guaranteed that your `Card` record function completely correctly if it passes all the tests, but it is a
  very good check!

---

### 📌 **Step 2b: Expected Output**

Once you implement `UniqueHands.java`, your program should produce output **similar to this**:

```
🃏 Deck Simulation: How long to see every possible hand?
------------------------------------------------------

Deck Size: 24 | Hand Size: 6 | Trial 5 | Attempts: 1,623,150 | Time: 5.902 sec
✅ Deck Size: 24 | Hand Size: 6 | Avg Attempts: 1,592,873 | Avg Time: 5.719 sec

✅ Deck Size: 24 | Hand Size: 7 | Avg Attempts: 4,506,103 | Avg Time: 25.205 sec
------------------------------------------------------
Deck Size: 28 | Hand Size: 6 | Trial 1 | Attempts: 5,021,739 | Time: 22.837 sec

✅ Deck Size: 28 | Hand Size: 6 | Avg Attempts: 4,997,017 | Avg Time: 22.585 sec
------------------------------------------------------
```

To produce output like the sample, your `main()` method must:

### **✅ 1. Set Up Deck & Hand Size Loops**

- They need to **loop through different deck sizes** (`24, 28`).
- Inside that, **loop through hand sizes** (`6, 7`).
- Inside that, **run multiple trials** (5 trials per deck-hand size pair).

---

### **✅ 2. Track and Print Progress During `countAttemptsToSeeAllHands()`**

- Every **100,000 attempts**, print:
    - **Percentage coverage**
    - **Total unique hands seen**
    - **Total unique hands possible**
    - **How many unique hands are still needed**
- Stop printing progress when 100% is reached.

---

### **✅ 3. Track Total Attempts & Execution Time for Each Trial**

- Record **how many attempts** it took to see every hand.
- Use `System.nanoTime()` at **start** and **end** to calculate execution time.
- Print the final summary:

  ```
  ✅ 100.00% coverage reached after 1,576,221 attempts (Unique Hands: 134,596 / 134,596 | Needed: 0)
  Deck Size: 24 | Hand Size: 6 | Trial 1 | Attempts: 1,576,221 | Time: 6.176 sec
  ```

---

### **✅ 4. Save Results to CSV**

- Write a CSV file with **deck size, hand size, trial #, attempts, and time.**
- Example:

  ```
  Deck Size,Hand Size,Trial,Attempts,Time (sec)
  24,6,1,1576221,6.176
  24,6,2,1593462,5.268
  ```
